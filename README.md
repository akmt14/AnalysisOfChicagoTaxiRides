# Analysis Of Chicago Taxi Rides

Uber & Lyft have started challenging the local cab drivers across major cities across the US - Chicago, New York, San Francisco & Los Angeles just to name a few. The average cost of a taxi medallion was around $357,000 in Chicago in late 2013. Now, its $35,000. According to an article in USA Today in June 2017, about 42% of Chicagoâ€™s taxi fleet was not operating in the month of March 2017, as riders are increasingly ditching cabs for ride-hailing apps - Uber & Lyft. Wanting to see this for myself, I did some research on the topic & found this dataset that consisted of Chicago Taxi Rides on the Chicago Open Data Source website.

Unfortunately, github is not able to render my maps, so please refer to the link below to view the entire analysis.
